                    <h3>Mental Health</h3>
                    <p>Good mental health is essential to overall well-being. More than 1 in 5 women in the United States experienced a mental health condition in the past year, such as depression or anxiety.1 Many mental health conditions, such as depression and bipolar disorder, affect more women than men or affect women in different ways from men.2,3 Most serious mental health conditions cannot be cured. But they can be treated, so you can get better and live well.<a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/mental-health"> More...</a></p>

                    <h3>Reproductive Health</h3>
                    <p>The menstrual cycle is the hormonal process a woman's body goes through each month to prepare for a possible pregnancy. Regular menstrual periods in the years between puberty and menopause are usually a sign that your body is working normally. Irregular or heavy, painful periods are not normal. Many women also get premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms. You can take steps at home and talk to your doctor or nurse about ways to treat your period problems and PMS.<a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/menstrual-cycle"> More...</a></p>

                    <h3>Empowerment</h3>
                    <p>The patriarchal culture has kept women in subordinate positions in all the spheres of life, from political decision making spheres to family circles. Empowering women and raising awareness of women and men on womenâ€™s rights contributes to limiting the power of gender stereotypes that prevent women from participating fully in the social, professional and public life and deprives them from their full citizenship. Marginalization, violence and discrimination committed against women is not a fatality, the feminine nature does not exist but is just a male invention to keep women out of the history.</p>
